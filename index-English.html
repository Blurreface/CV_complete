			<p>My name is Jackeline Rebeca Evora Chávez. I was born on June twenty-six, two thousand and four, at the “Dr. José Molina Martínez". I was born with a disease for which I had to be hospitalized for two months after I was born, in which I could not receive any kind of affection from my mother or my father; for this reason I did not have breastfeeding, And I only drank processed milk, I think that affected my well-being a bit, but I also created a bit of independence from my mother.
				<br> <br>
				Since I was little, different challenges and responsibilities were imposed on me; at the age of four he was able to go shopping independently. I have always liked to be friendly and I try to have a good relationship with everyone. At school I was the most sociable, I always tried to please everyone. <br>
				When it comes time to enter school, I stand out easily, most of the time I had good grades, to be honest, I love the fact of having new knowledge, what I don't like are evaluations, I get very nervous. Leaving that aside a bit, I had good grades and from kindergarten to ninth grade I received a first place medal, with the exception of second grade, there they gave me a second place medal, but I did not take much importance, because for me it was still good . for
				In sixth grade I received a basic level computer science diploma from a course in the national air force of El Salvador and later in ninth grade I was able to participate in a math contest. I guess I went through opportunities that others did not have and the good thing was to take advantage of them. In eighth grade I got the scholarship <a href="CV_Acade.html#superate"> Get over ADOC! </a> and spent three years studying there. Being part of this scholarship helped me in many ways, at the same time I was carrying out my general high school studies with a diploma in bakery, in which I had internships. In this case, the competitiveness was great and I couldn't stand out much, but I had some participations. <br> <br>
				I consider that everything that I have gone through has turned me into what I am now, an attentive, understanding, friendly person; someone who shares diverse points of view, who likes to work in a team. I adapt easily to situations, in addition to that I have learned to handle the stress of having several commitments at the same time. I am satisfied with who I am and I hope to be what others need.

			<h1>Respet</h1>
			<p>One of the values that I like to put into practice is respect, since I consider that it is something essential in life, and it is not only put into practice, professionally, but also personally. Respect is something that I like to show and that I like to be shown with me.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="peqdivs" style="float: right; margin-right: 1em; position: relative;">
			<h1>Comprehension</h1>
			<p>Understanding is something that I have always needed, we do not all think the same or we have not all had the same opportunities; That is why I consider that understanding is of great importance. It can not only be to understand someone in a situation, if not to understand their emotions, their thoughts, everything. I am very understanding, because I also want you to be understanding with me.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="peqdivs" style="float: left; margin-left: 2em; position: relative;">
			<h1>Persistent</h1>
			<p>This value is the one that most stands out to me, no matter how difficult a situation or a problem is, I try to find a solution for it and if nothing occurs to me, I seek help, analyze the points of view of others and never despise an opinion.</p>

			<br><br>
			<p>
				My family is made up of my mom, my dad, my sister and me. Some of my relatives live close to me; two aunts, and cousins, of all that generation, I am the oldest. Sometimes I took care of my cousins, I changed and fed them. Besides that, I have an aunt who has a degree in nursing and another aunt is a language teacher for basic education. My other relatives are only high school graduates, but they have had different work experiences, of which they have taught me several things. for
				My family is my treasure, I hope I can help my sister so that she can have better opportunities than me, and she can fulfill her dreams. <br> <br>
				I hope and I have faith in God that everything will turn out as I hope, that one day I will be able to help my family just as they have given me not only financial but also emotional help.
